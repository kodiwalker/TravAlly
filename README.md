## About The Project

<img src="/assets/TravAlly-Tools.png" width="250"/>

Traveling the world can be an exciting and life-changing experience. But the logistics can often get complicated - dealing with different time zones, navigating foreign languages, understanding local culture, and more. Enter TravAlly, your all-in-one travel assistant app designed to simplify your global explorations.

Developed during a fast-paced, 3-day sprint at Hack Reactor, TravAlly aims to consolidate all essential travel tools into one convenient and user-friendly application. With its bi-directional functionalities and intuitive icon design, you can focus more on the experience of travel, less on the hassle.

The app is currently still in development and not available on any app store.
